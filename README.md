The App Checker App is a college essay checker that identifies the instances where you reference the college you're applying to and instances where you reference other colleges in order for you to make sure that you are always talking about the correct college.

## What is the purpose?
College admissions have become increasingly competitive in the last few years and many equally qualified candidates are fighting for the same limited number of spots at universities. As a result, admissions officers need a way to quickly weed out candidates who appear to be apathetic toward applying to the college, or are less dedicated and mindful. Mentioning the wrong college can seem like an indicator of both of those things and should be avoided at all costs.
